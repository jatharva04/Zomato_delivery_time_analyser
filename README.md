# Zomato Delivery Time Analyser

A data science project to analyze the factors influencing Zomato's food delivery times and to build a foundation for a predictive machine learning model.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data profiling using **Pandas Profiling**
- Data cleaning with **PyJanitor**
- Feature engineering (time-of-day flags, distance calculation, etc.)
- Data validation with **Great Expectations**
- Version control for data using **DVC**
- Visualizations and insights for delivery patterns
- Statistical analysis to identify key parameters 
- document findings from the EDA to inform the development of a predictive model

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```
The repository is organized into a standard data science project structure:
â”œâ”€â”€ .dvc/                  <- DVC internal files
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                  <- DVC-tracked data and .dvc files
â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_nb/         <- EDA and experimental python code and notebooks
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/               <- Generated reports like data profiles
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore             <- Files to be ignored by Git
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              <- Project documentation
